/*
You are given a string S consisting of N characters and an integer K. 
You can modify string S by removing any substring of it. 
A substring is defined as a contiguous segment of a string.

The goal is to find the shortest substring of S that, after removal, 
leaves S containing exactly K different characters.


Write a function that, given a non-empty string S consisting of N characters and an integer K, 
returns the length of the shortest substring that can be removed. If there is no such substring, 
your function should return âˆ’1.
