/*
Write a function solution that, given an array A consisting of N integers, 

returns the maximum sum of two numbers whose digits add up to an equal sum. 

If there are no two numbers whose digits have an equal sum, the function should return -1.

Examples:
- Given A = [51, 71, 17, 42], the function should return 93.
- Given A = [42, 33, 60], the function should return 102. 
- Given A = [51, 32, 43], the function should return -1.

Qs:
1. Can there be negative integers?
- No. There are only positive integers.
