/*
Number of Ways to Paint N Ã— 3 Grid

You have a grid of size n x 3 and you want to paint each cell of the grid with exactly one of the three colors: Red, Yellow, or Green

while making sure that no two adjacent cells have the same color

(i.e., no two cells that share vertical or horizontal sides have the same color).

Given n the number of rows of the grid, return the number of ways you can paint this grid.

As the answer may grow large, the answer must be computed modulo 109 + 7.
*/

/*
cur123: the total number of ways of painting the grid from first row to current row where current row is 3-colored
cur121: the total number of ways of painting the grid from first row to current row where current row is 2-colored

Possible 123-pattern arrangements after row of 123 pattern: 2
Possible 123-pattern arrangements after row of 121 pattern: 2

Possible 121-pattern arrangements after row of 123 pattern: 2
Possible 121-pattern arrangements after row of 121 pattern: 3

Hence, cur123 = prev123 * 2 + prev121 * 2 and cur121 = prev123 * 2 + prev121 * 3
