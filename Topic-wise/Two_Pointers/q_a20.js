/*
Minimum Number of K Consecutive Bit Flips

In an array nums containing only 0s and 1s, a k-bit flip consists of choosing a (contiguous) subarray of length k 

and simultaneously changing every 0 in the subarray to 1, and every 1 in the subarray to 0.

Return the minimum number of k-bit flips required so that there is no 0 in the array.  If it is not possible, return -1.
