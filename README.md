# Interview Prep in JavaScript

First seven folders from `a_First 100` to `g_Seventh 100` consist of a total of 700 random interview questions. You may find the same questions more than once because I often find myself solving the same question over and over. <br/>

The other folders consist of company-specific questions and topic-specific questions. <br/>

Each solution has a detailed explanation. I hope it helps your interview prep :)<br/>
